### Points

1. Choosing `clap` vs `seahorse`
    1. Clap has most likes in github compared to seahorse
    2. Clap tag seems simple but it has arg parser to custom type, sub-commands, etc on the other case seahorse is a minimal framework
    3. Clap has more community and addons like commands auto complete in zsh.

2. Choosing `opentelemetry-rust` vs `tracing` crate
    1. It seems official opentelemetry only telling to use `tracing`
    2. Also, tracking crate has more commnuity supporting other crates like send data to `chrome:://tracing`
